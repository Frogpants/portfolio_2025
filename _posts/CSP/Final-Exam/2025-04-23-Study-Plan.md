# AP CSP Weekly Study Plan  
**April 23 – May 15, 2025**

---

## Week 1: April 23 – April 27  
**Focus: Programming Fundamentals & Loop Logic**

- **Learn & Practice**:
  - Review variables, conditionals, and functions.
  - Dive deep into loops: `for`, `while`, nested loops, and loop tracing.
  - Practice writing loop-based problems: sums, filters, patterns.
- **Code Activities**:
  - Create a function that loops through lists of user profiles and filters based on themes.
  - Modify a loop to process JSON response data like in your PPR API.
- **Reflection**:
  - Write a short summary of how loops were used in your profile management feature (e.g., reading lists of users).
  - Identify ways you could improve efficiency or code clarity.

## Week 2: April 28 – May 4  
**Focus: API Practice, Lists, & Abstraction**

- **Learn & Practice**:
  - Understand data abstraction through lists and dictionaries.
  - Practice writing CRUD operations using simulated APIs or mock data.
  - Review your PPR’s use of `query.all()` and `read()` methods.
- **Code Activities**:
  - Build a mock API that stores and returns user data.
  - Create a program that reads a list of user objects and updates specific fields.
- **Reflection**:
  - How did abstraction help simplify your project?
  - Discuss how you used dictionaries to represent structured data like profile info.

## Week 3: May 5 – May 11  
**Focus: Cybersecurity & Internet Systems**

- **Learn & Practice**:
  - Study key protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP.
  - Learn how APIs work securely over the internet.
  - Review encryption basics (symmetric vs. asymmetric), SSL, and how security threats (e.g., phishing, spoofing) occur.
- **Code/Activity Ideas**:
  - Trace the flow of a user’s login through your backend, showing where data is vulnerable.
  - Diagram how your project handles secure communication.
- **Reflection**:
  - Write about one way your project protects user data.
  - Identify one potential vulnerability and how you might improve it.

## Week 4: May 12 – May 15  
**Focus: Final Integration & Performance Task Reflection**

- **Review**:
  - Practice revising key lessons: loops, data abstraction, cybersecurity, API usage.
  - Read sample responses for Create PT write-ups and compare with your own.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a final blog-style reflection explaining how each element of the CSP curriculum is present in your user profile feature.
  - Update or expand your PPR with visuals, API flowcharts, or real screenshots.
- **Reflection**:
  - What part of the project are you most proud of?
  - What technical challenge taught you the most?
  - What would you do differently with more time?

    "- **Profile Page Development**: Built the user profile page with Flask-RESTful, implementing CRUD operations for users to create, update, and delete profiles. This improved my understanding of API design and user data management.  \n",
    "- **Search Bar Recommendations**: Contributed to the recommendation system, aligning with the **New User** story by automatically suggesting items based on past searches and interactions. I learned how to dynamically adjust the recommendations for new users.  \n",
    "- **User Stories Implementation**: Focused on fulfilling both **New User** and **General User** stories by creating a recommendation system that adapts based on user behavior. This taught me how to build features that evolve with user preferences.  \n",
    "- **Database Management**: Improved database scripts (`db_init.py`, `db_backup.py`, `db_restore.py`) for better data handling and consistency, learning how to ensure efficient data management across the backend.  \n",
    "- **Full Stack Integration**: Worked on connecting the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth communication between profile data and recommendations. This reinforced the importance of full-stack development and real-time data handling.\n",

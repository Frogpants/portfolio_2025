    "- **Profile Page Development**: Built the user profile page with Flask-RESTful, implementing CRUD operations for users to create, update, and delete profiles. This improved my understanding of API design and user data management.  \n",
    "- **Search Bar Recommendations**: Contributed to the recommendation system, aligning with the **New User** story by automatically suggesting items based on past searches and interactions. I learned how to dynamically adjust the recommendations for new users.  \n",
    "- **User Stories Implementation**: Focused on fulfilling both **New User** and **General User** stories by creating a recommendation system that adapts based on user behavior. This taught me how to build features that evolve with user preferences.  \n",
    "- **Database Management**: Improved database scripts (`db_init.py`, `db_backup.py`, `db_restore.py`) for better data handling and consistency, learning how to ensure efficient data management across the backend.  \n",
    "- **Full Stack Integration**: Worked on connecting the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth communication between profile data and recommendations. This reinforced the importance of full-stack development and real-time data handling.\n",

    "| **Input**                  | The API accepts `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests with JSON payloads that include `user_id`, `link`, `name`, and `theme`. |\n",
    "| **Use of List/Collection Type** | Profiles are stored in a database, and multiple profiles can be retrieved using the `GET /user_profiles` endpoint, which returns a collection of user profiles. |\n",
    "| **Procedure**              | The API handles CRUD operations for user profiles. It processes requests by creating, reading, updating, and deleting profiles in the database. |\n",
    "| **Algorithm**              | The system uses token authentication to authorize requests. Profile data is matched to user IDs, and actions (create, read, update, delete) are performed based on the provided `user_id`. |\n",
    "| **Output**                 | The API returns JSON responses for each operation, including the profile data after creation or updates, and messages on successful or failed operations. |\n"
